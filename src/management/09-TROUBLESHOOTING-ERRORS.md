## Understanding Error Messages

### How to Read an Error

Every error message has these parts:

```
Error: Cannot find module './MyComponent'
    at Object.<anonymous> (src/App.tsx:5:1)
```

1. **Error Type**: `Cannot find module` - What went wrong
2. **Details**: `'./MyComponent'` - Specific information
3. **Location**: `src/App.tsx:5:1` - File name, line 5, character 1

### Where to Find Errors

1. **Terminal**: Where you ran `npm run dev`
2. **Browser Console**: Press `F12` → Click "Console" tab
3. **Browser Page**: Sometimes errors show on the page itself

---

## Terminal/Command Line Errors

### Error: "npm: command not found"

**What it means**: Node.js is not installed on your computer.

**How to fix**:
1. Go to https://nodejs.org
2. Download the "LTS" version (the one that says "Recommended")
3. Run the installer
4. Close your terminal and open a new one
5. Try your command again

---

### Error: "ENOENT: no such file or directory"

**What it means**: You're trying to open a folder or file that doesn't exist.

**How to fix**:
1. Check if you spelled the folder name correctly
2. Make sure you're in the right folder
3. Use `ls` (Mac/Linux) or `dir` (Windows) to see what's in your current folder

**Example**:
```bash
# Wrong - folder doesn't exist
cd my-project

# Check what folders exist
ls

# Then go to the correct folder
cd practice-hub
```

---

### Error: "EACCES: permission denied"

**What it means**: You don't have permission to do something.

**How to fix (Mac/Linux)**:
```bash
sudo npm install
```
Then type your computer password.

**How to fix (Windows)**:
1. Close your terminal
2. Right-click on "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell"
3. Click "Run as administrator"
4. Try your command again

---

### Error: "npm ERR! code ERESOLVE"

**What it means**: Some packages don't work well together.

**How to fix**:
```bash
# Delete node_modules folder and package-lock.json
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# On Windows, use:
rmdir /s node_modules
del package-lock.json

# Install again
npm install
```

---

### Error: "Port 8080 is already in use"

**What it means**: Another program is using port 8080.

**How to fix**:

**Option 1**: Find and close the other program

**Option 2**: Use a different port
```bash
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```
Then open http://localhost:3000 instead

**Option 3 (Mac/Linux)**: Kill the process using port 8080
```bash
lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9
```

---

## Browser Console Errors

### Error: "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'"

**What it means**: The browser expected JavaScript but got HTML instead.

**Common causes**:
1. Wrong file path for a script
2. Server returned a 404 error page

**How to fix**:
1. Check that all your import paths are correct
2. Make sure the file you're importing exists
3. Restart the development server: Stop it (Ctrl+C) and run `npm run dev` again

---

### Error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'xxx')"

**What it means**: You're trying to use something that doesn't exist.

**Example of the problem**:
```javascript
const user = undefined;
console.log(user.name);  // ERROR! user is undefined
```

**How to fix**: Add a check before using the value:
```javascript
const user = undefined;
console.log(user?.name);  // Safe! Returns undefined instead of crashing
```

**In your quiz code**, this might happen if:
- A question is missing a required field
- The questions array is empty

---

### Error: "404 Not Found" in Network tab

**What it means**: A file or page doesn't exist.

**How to fix**:
1. Check the URL that's failing (in the Network tab)
2. Make sure the file exists in your project
3. Check spelling and capitalization (matters on Linux servers!)

---

## Build Errors

### Error: "Module not found: Can't resolve 'xxx'"

**What it means**: You're trying to import something that doesn't exist.

**How to fix**:

1. **Check the file path**:
   ```typescript
   // Wrong - file doesn't exist
   import { Button } from './components/Buttons';
   
   // Correct
   import { Button } from './components/ui/button';
   ```

2. **Check if package is installed**:
   ```bash
   npm install package-name
   ```

3. **Check spelling**:
   - File names are case-sensitive!
   - `Button.tsx` is different from `button.tsx`

---

### Error: "Export 'xxx' was not found in 'yyy'"

**What it means**: You're importing something that the file doesn't export.

**How to fix**:

1. **Check what's actually exported**:
   ```typescript
   // In the file you're importing from:
   export const MyButton = () => {...}  // Named export
   export default MyButton;              // Default export
   ```

2. **Import correctly**:
   ```typescript
   // For named export:
   import { MyButton } from './MyButton';
   
   // For default export:
   import MyButton from './MyButton';
   ```

---

### Error: "Type 'xxx' is not assignable to type 'yyy'"

**What it means**: TypeScript expected one type but got another.

**Example**:
```typescript
// Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
const age: number = "twenty-five";

// Fixed:
const age: number = 25;
```

**How to fix**:
1. Change the value to match the expected type
2. Change the type definition to match the value
3. If the value can be multiple types, use union types: `string | number`

---

## React Errors

### Error: "Each child in a list should have a unique 'key' prop"

**What it means**: When you show a list of items, each needs a unique identifier.

**Wrong**:
```tsx
{questions.map(q => (
  <div>{q.text}</div>  // No key!
))}
```

**Correct**:
```tsx
{questions.map(q => (
  <div key={q.id}>{q.text}</div>  // Has unique key
))}
```

---

### Error: "Too many re-renders"

**What it means**: Your component is updating infinitely.

**Common cause**:
```tsx
// Wrong - this causes infinite loop!
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
setCount(count + 1);  // Runs every render, causes another render

// Correct - only run once on mount
useEffect(() => {
  setCount(count + 1);
}, []);  // Empty array = run once
```

**How to fix**:
- Put state updates inside `useEffect`
- Make sure `useEffect` dependencies don't change every render

---

### Error: "Invalid hook call"

**What it means**: You're using hooks incorrectly.

**Rules for hooks**:
1. Only call hooks at the top level of your component
2. Never call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions

**Wrong**:
```tsx
function MyComponent({ show }) {
  if (show) {
    const [value, setValue] = useState(0);  // Wrong! Inside condition
  }
}
```

**Correct**:
```tsx
function MyComponent({ show }) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(0);  // Correct! At top level
  
  if (!show) return null;
  return <div>{value}</div>;
}
```

---

### Error: "Objects are not valid as a React child"

**What it means**: You're trying to display an object directly.

**Wrong**:
```tsx
const user = { name: "John", age: 25 };
return <div>{user}</div>;  // Error! Can't display object
```

**Correct**:
```tsx
const user = { name: "John", age: 25 };
return <div>{user.name}</div>;  // Display specific property
```

---

## TypeScript Errors

### Error: "Property 'xxx' does not exist on type 'yyy'"

**What it means**: You're trying to use a property that TypeScript doesn't know about.

**How to fix**:

1. **Add the property to the type**:
   ```typescript
   interface Question {
     id: string;
     text: string;
     newProperty: string;  // Add it here
   }
   ```

2. **Check spelling** - `questionText` vs `questiontext`

3. **Make it optional if it might not exist**:
   ```typescript
   interface Question {
     id: string;
     image?: string;  // ? means optional
   }
   ```

---

### Error: "Argument of type 'xxx' is not assignable to parameter of type 'yyy'"

**What it means**: You're passing the wrong type to a function.

**Example**:
```typescript
function greet(name: string) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
}

greet(123);  // Error! Expected string, got number
greet("John");  // Correct
```

---

## Styling Errors

### Problem: Styles not applying

**Check these things**:

1. **Class name spelling**:
   ```tsx
   // Wrong
   <div className="bg-blu-500">
   
   // Correct
   <div className="bg-blue-500">
   ```

2. **Using className not class**:
   ```tsx
   // Wrong (HTML syntax)
   <div class="my-class">
   
   // Correct (React syntax)
   <div className="my-class">
   ```

3. **Tailwind classes exist**:
   - Check https://tailwindcss.com/docs for valid classes

---

### Problem: Dark mode not working

**Check these things**:

1. Make sure you're using theme variables:
   ```tsx
   // Wrong - hardcoded color
   <div className="bg-white text-black">
   
   // Correct - uses theme
   <div className="bg-background text-foreground">
   ```

2. Theme toggle is working in localStorage

---

## Data/Question Errors

### Problem: Questions not showing

**Check these things**:

1. **Questions file is exported correctly**:
   ```typescript
   // At bottom of questions file:
   export const myQuestions: Question[] = [...];
   ```

2. **Questions are imported in the right place**:
   - Check the category page imports the questions
   - Check the unit configuration includes the topic

3. **Question format is correct**:
   ```typescript
   {
     id: "unique-id",  // Required!
     type: "multiple-choice",  // Required!
     question: "What is 2+2?",  // Required!
     options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],  // Required for MC!
     correctAnswer: "4",  // Required!
   }
   ```

---

### Problem: Images not loading

**Check these things**:

1. **Image path is correct**:
   ```typescript
   // For public folder images:
   image: "/images/chemistry/atomic1.png"
   
   // Note: starts with / and path from public folder
   ```

2. **File actually exists** in the exact location

3. **File name matches exactly** (including capitalization)

---

### Problem: Wrong answer not being saved

**Check these things**:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Go to Application tab → Local Storage
3. Look for `quiz-wrong-answers`
4. If it's corrupted, delete it and refresh

---

## Git Errors

### Error: "fatal: not a git repository"

**What it means**: You're not in a Git folder.

**How to fix**:
```bash
# Check if you're in the right folder
pwd

# Navigate to your project folder
cd your-project-name

# Or initialize git if needed
git init
```

---

### Error: "Your branch is behind 'origin/main'"

**What it means**: Someone else pushed changes you don't have.

**How to fix**:
```bash
git pull
```

---

### Error: "Merge conflict in xxx"

**What it means**: Git can't automatically combine changes.

**How to fix**:
1. Open the file with the conflict
2. Look for these markers:
   ```
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   Your changes
   =======
   Their changes
   >>>>>>> branch-name
   ```
3. Decide which version to keep (or combine them)
4. Delete the `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` lines
5. Save the file
6. Run:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
   ```

---

### Error: "Permission denied (publickey)"

**What it means**: GitHub doesn't recognize your computer.

**How to fix**:

1. **Generate SSH key**:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
   ```
   Press Enter for all prompts.

2. **Copy the key**:
   ```bash
   # Mac:
   pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   
   # Windows:
   clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   
   # Linux:
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   # Then copy the output manually
   ```

3. **Add to GitHub**:
   - Go to GitHub.com → Settings → SSH and GPG keys
   - Click "New SSH key"
   - Paste your key
   - Click "Add SSH key"

## Common Fixes for Everything

### The Universal Fix: Restart Everything

When in doubt, try this sequence:

1. **Stop the development server**: Press `Ctrl + C` in terminal

2. **Clear the browser cache**:
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (hard refresh)
   - Or open DevTools (F12) → Right-click refresh button → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

3. **Delete node_modules and reinstall**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   ```

4. **Restart the server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

---

### The Nuclear Option: Start Fresh

If nothing else works:

1. **Save your question files** - copy them somewhere safe

2. **Clone the repository again**:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   rm -rf your-project-folder
   git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
   cd repo
   npm install
   ```

3. **Copy your question files back**

4. **Test**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

---

### How to Search for Help

When you get an error you don't understand:

1. **Copy the exact error message**

2. **Google it** with "react" or "vite" or "typescript":
   - "react Cannot read properties of undefined"
   - "vite module not found"

3. **Check Stack Overflow** - usually the first result

4. **Look at the "Related" questions** on Stack Overflow

---

### How to Ask for Help

When posting on forums or asking someone:

1. **Include the exact error message**
2. **Include the relevant code** (not the whole file)
3. **Explain what you were trying to do**
4. **Explain what you expected to happen**
5. **Explain what actually happened**

**Good example**:
> I'm trying to add a new question to my quiz app. When I run `npm run dev`, I get this error:
> ```
> Error: Property 'options' is missing in type...
> ```
> Here's my question object:
> ```typescript
> { id: "q1", question: "What is 2+2?", correctAnswer: "4" }
> ```
> I expected it to work but I get a type error.
