    question: 'Predict the relationship between light intensity and the rate of photosynthesis. Justify your answer using the light-dependent reactions.',
    correctAnswer: 'Light intensity determines the rate of photosynthesis because light energizes electrons in the light-dependent reactions. Higher light intensity increases ATP and NADPH production, resulting in more oxygen released.',
    explanation: 'The light-dependent reactions rely on photons to excite electrons. More light increases electron flow and ATP/NADPH production—up to a saturation point.'

    question: 'At high light intensity, the farmer observes that the rate of photosynthesis levels off. Propose a biological explanation for this phenomenon.',
    correctAnswer: 'Photosynthesis has a limit because the enzymes and electron carriers involved reach their maximum capacity. Once the light-dependent reactions are saturated, the plant cannot increase ATP or NADPH production further.',
    explanation: 'Even with more light, photosynthesis is limited by factors such as enzyme speed, available electron carriers, and Calvin cycle capacity.'

    question: 'If the farmer wanted to improve crop growth, what additional environmental factor might she manipulate? Explain how this factor would affect photosynthesis.',
    correctAnswer: 'She could increase the amount of CO2 available. Higher CO2 levels speed up the Calvin cycle, allowing more glucose production as long as light and water are sufficient.',
    explanation: 'CO2 is the carbon source for the Calvin cycle. More CO2 reduces the chance that RuBisCO binds oxygen instead, increasing photosynthetic efficiency.'

    question: 'Explain why oxygen consumption plateaus during prolonged high-intensity exercise, even though muscles are still active.',
    correctAnswer: 'Oxygen becomes limiting because the cardiovascular and respiratory systems cannot deliver O2 fast enough. Once maximum oxygen uptake is reached, muscles supplement with anaerobic respiration (lactic acid fermentation).',
    explanation: 'VO₂ max represents the highest oxygen delivery rate. Beyond this point, ATP demand exceeds aerobic capacity, forcing cells to rely more on anaerobic pathways.'

    type: 'free-response',
    question: 'Describe how the rise in CO2 production reflects the changes in cellular respiration during exercise.',
    correctAnswer: 'Increased CO2 indicates increased cellular respiration because the Krebs cycle and pyruvate oxidation release CO2 as byproducts when ATP demand rises.',
    explanation: 'As muscles use more ATP, glucose is broken down at a faster rate, producing more CO2 from the mitochondrial reactions involved in aerobic respiration.'

    question: 'Predict what would happen if the athletes ran out of glucose during the exercise. Identify which pathway would be affected first and explain how the body might compensate.',
    correctAnswer: 'If athletes ran out of glucose, glycolysis would be affected first since it requires glucose. The body would compensate by breaking down fats (beta-oxidation) and, if needed, proteins to supply energy.',
    explanation: 'Glycolysis depends directly on glucose levels. When glucose is low, the body switches to lipid catabolism for ATP production, which is slower but longer-lasting.'
