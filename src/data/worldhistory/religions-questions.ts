    question: 'Compare and contrast Buddhism and Hinduism by discussing how they are similar to and different from one another. Be sure to include at least 2 specific examples of similarities AND two specific examples of differences.',
    correctAnswer: 'Similarities: (1) Both accept the ideas of karma and reincarnation; (2) Both originated in South Asia and discuss liberation from the cycle of rebirth. Differences: (1) Hinduism teaches the eternal soul (atman) and the aim of union with Brahman (moksha), while Buddhism denies a permanent atman and aims for nirvana; (2) Hinduism has a caste-based social structure historically and a variety of deities and devotional paths, while early Buddhism rejected the caste-based authority of Brahmins and emphasized an ethical path (the Eightfold Path) to end suffering.',
    explanation: 'Provide a short, clear comparison: both religions address suffering, karma, and rebirth (similarities). They diverge on the existence of a permanent soul (Hindu atman vs Buddhist anatta/no-self) and on social ritual structures (caste and priestly authority in Hinduism vs Buddhism\'s monastic and ethical focus).'

Differences: (1) Christianity believes Jesus is the Messiah and divine, central to salvation; Judaism does not accept Jesus as the Messiah; (2) Christianity emphasizes faith in Jesus and the New Testament teachings, while Judaism focuses on following the Torah\'s laws and covenantal practices.',
    explanation: 'Keep it direct: both faiths share roots, moral laws, and many texts (similarities). They differ on the identity and role of Jesus, the interpretation of covenant and law, and the role of scripture beyond the Hebrew Bible (Christian New Testament vs Jewish rabbinic tradition).'
